        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> Electronic security locks are replacing traditional mechanicals locks for their ease of use, security,
            flexibility and they provide us very important features such as remote or automatic control and
            intrusion alarms.
            <br>
            I think the electronic security lock consists of 3 main components: Authorization, lock/unlock mechanism
            and intrusion alarm.
            <br>
            In this project, We will be studying and implementing an efficient authorization method for the
            electronic security lock.
            <br>
            There are many authorization methods for electronic lock such as
        </p>
        <ol class="w-75">
            <li>
                Using a <strong>keypad</strong> to get a password from the user and match it with the preset
                password.
                <br>
                This approach is very cheap, but it is not very efficient as it takes some time for the user to
                enter the password, the password could be leaked or guessed, or the user might forget the password!
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a <strong>fingerprint</strong> sensor to get the users’ fingerprint and match it with the
                preset fingerprints of the authorized users.
                <br>
                This is a better approach from the last one, It’s easier, user friendly and very secure. But still
                the user has to put his finger in the sensor, and it has a high cost. (A retinal scanning is a
                similar approach)
            </li>
            <li>
                Using a <strong>camera</strong> to get the users’ face and match it with the stored photos of the
                authorized users.
                <br>
                This approach is the easiest as the lock automatically opens once the user gets closer. It provides
                good security, but it is less secure than fingerprint approach, it doesn’t cost much, it provides
                extra features such as 24 hours surveillance and logging. I will use this method for my project.
            </li>

        </ol>

                <p>
                    To do this we will need to use computer vision to detect all the faces in the photos taken by
                    the
                    camera
                    and match them with the authorized users’ faces stored in the database.
                    We will also add some extra features to make this lock remotely controlled, by streaming this
                    camera
                    output to some online platform on the internet and providing the lock owners with a UI in this
                    platform
                    to control the lock from anywhere.
